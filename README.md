A HoloLens application to visualize the alignment of bone models from MRI and Ultrasound scans.

> **NOTE:** This project was simply a proof of concept and no development will be done on it in the foreseeable future. An identical project, but on the Google Cardboard rather than Hololens, is in active development [here](https://github.com/davrempe/card-bone-viz).

Currently just the HoloLens template from Visual Studio modified to load in and render an example bone data file 2 m in front of the user.
